    <h1>üß™ Cross framework component (POC)</h1>
    <strong>POC of cross framework component with different approaches based on web components API</strong>
</div>
<br>
<br>

## ü§î Motivation

This repository aims to experiment several approaches to foster cross framework components.
All approaches are based on web component API to create custom components that can be used anywhere without being tied to a specific framework.

One of the objectives is to test the impact on performance and size footprint (all frameworks expected vanilla (even compiler based one such as Stencil and Svelte) include more or less a tiny runtime to manage their design constraints (eg. for handling [virtual dom](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil/tree/main/src/runtime), async rendering, or [component lifecycle](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/blob/467ba0a920d9b9902a2059085bac2662c6813b9a/src/runtime/internal/lifecycle.ts)...))
