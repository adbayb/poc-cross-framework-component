    <strong>Experiment cross-framework component implementation on top of shared framework agnostic logic</strong>

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

```bash
# hoisting necessary to make Nuxt example works 
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
pnpm start
```

## ðŸŒŸ Architecture

Primitives are framework agnostic building blocks that hide framework implementation complexity.  
They allow to build high-level components without dealing with framework specificities.  
Each primitive acts as [an adapter](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/adapter) to plug framework dependent logic:
